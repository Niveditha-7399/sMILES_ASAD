# sMILES_ASAD
Collection of scripts that assist with a research project that analyzes observed spectral data of star clusters using full-spectrum fitting with sMILES models. The scripts are designed for using with Analyzer of integrated Spectra for Age, henceforth abbreviated in this project as ASAD. 

## filter_sMILES_models.py
This script filters observations by providing the indices of observations to be removed.

## BC03_all_model_compilation.py
This script is used to create a single model file from a folder full of BC03 (Bruzual & Charlot 2003) models. The BC03 model compilation was used for testing with some outliers in the observations as well as
the sMILES models. It creates a single model file to be compatible
with Analyzer of integrated Spectra for Age.
